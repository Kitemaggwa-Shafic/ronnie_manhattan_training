# create in 1990s by Guido Van Russom
# started in Xmass season, with urge of creating a lnsguage as powerfull as C but easyto write
# he wanted to simplify C, and easy as B created  a laguange AB which is part of C and B and this language has no name
# he was watching a commedy clip, he was watching its montey Py and then named his language AB "PYTHON"
# A python file is called a script
# Python is dynamically typed ie you don't need to specify variables
# Python is ...

# Python Syntax & Semantics 
# Syntax the rules that govern the use of a language eg in eng I did went (gramatically wrong) an empthatic verb with past tense
# Semantics the meaning of the rules of a language, most times the semantics can be right but the meaning wrong or VV
# 
# First semantic of python
# Telling a computer to reserve memory space



# Variables, Statement, Datatypes

# age = 15 # python variable

# # 1salary = 15
# # $country = 'uganda'     # not a python variable string variable

# mySalary = 5000    # camel casing
# my_salary = 9000   # using an underscore bttn word


# Adding two numbers
a = 17  # declaring a variable 'a' and assigning a value 17
b = 19
c = a + b
print("The sum is ", c)

# # Make a simple python program printing out of your name and address where you stay


# Cobine different variables as one
height = 200
weight = 65
name = "Manhattan"

# print(name, "You are", height,"cm and", weight,"kg")


num1, num2, num3 = 10,90,20
sum = num1+num2+num3
print(sum)

mynumber = yourNumber = ourNumber = 50
print("My number is",mynumber)   # 50
print("Your number is", yourNumber) # 50
print("Our number is", ourNumber)  # 50


# Operators
number1 = 10
number1 += 15
print(number1)

# Comparison operator
num1 = 90
num2 = 55
print(num1<num2)
print(num1>=num2)
print(num1<num2)


# Make another python program with details about you like height, weight and BMI

# Try to get to know about
# Arithmetic Operators or types in Python
'''
1. Mathematical Operators ie + - * /
2. floor division //
3. Exponential operator ** ie num1 ** num2
4. Modulus (%) a remender after a division, a small value % big value you remain with small value eg 5%10 is 5

myName = "Manhattan"


#  Variables in python
# num1 = 10
# num2 = 20

# num3 = num1 + num2

# print(type(num3))
